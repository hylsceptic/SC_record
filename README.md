# Introduction

This project want to create a decentralized website for users to post anything they want to post. The message will be posted on a smart contract, and each post relates to a user. For large files or figures, they will be uploaded to IPFS first, and then the hash will be recorded to the smart contract.

This project is still under development and waits for scaling. The current website is only for testing basic functions. A much more user friendly website is under design.

In the future, more decentralized techs will be adopted to create a more censorship resistant site.
